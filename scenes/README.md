Scene directories (preferably saved as .xml) should be placed here.

The Scene directorie goes like this:
<name of scene>
   <name of scene>.xml (or <name of scene>.scn)
   info.json

YOU MUST USE the same name for your directory and your main scene file
YOU MUST include an info.json file (but you can leave it empty if you don't want to add info about yourself)

You can copy the "Test" directory as an entry point

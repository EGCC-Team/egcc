The assets folder should have a neatly organized structure for different kinds of assets, such as:

	- sound effects (/sfx)
	- background music (/bgm)
	- images (/img) with optional addition of a folder for a specific group of objects within
	- fonts (/fnt)
	- materials and/or shaders (/shd or /shader?)
